
##About
#This was the first project for the Exploratory Data Analysis course in Coursera's Data Science specialization track. The objective was to practice creating plots by reproducing a series of four plots, and also to practice using github by forking and cloning an existing repository.

##Sypnosis
#The goal here was simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007 by reproducing a series of four plots. Due to specific image size requirements of the new plots, they will look slightly different than the originals.

##Data
#This project used data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. The "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" was used and made available on the course web site:

##Electric power consumption Dataset (20Mb)

##Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

#The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site

#Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
#Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
#Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
#Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
#Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
#Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
#Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
#Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
#Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
#Data Loading and Preprocessing
